# Python Engineering Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my code portfolio. This repository documents my journey in building robust software solutions using Python. It contains practical projects ranging from backend logic and automation to advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models.

## 🎯 Objective
To apply software engineering best practices (OOP, Modular Design, File I/O) in solving real-world business problems, eventually transitioning into building scalable AI/ML systems.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Core Concepts:** OOP (Classes/Objects), Data Structures, Algorithms, File Handling.
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code.
- **Upcoming:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch.
